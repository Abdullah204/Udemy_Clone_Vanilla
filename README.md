# Running instructions:
to run the project you need to put the json file on a local server and fetch it.  

# steps:   
1 - run the following command in the terminal :   
npm install -g json-server  
2- navigate to project directory.  
3- run the following command in the terminal :   
json-server --watch db.json    

the code automatically fetches the data from the local server but make sure you are running the server on port 3000 .
